 Iâ€™m May  ðŸ‘‹
I am a computer science graduate with a strong passion for exploring and applying cutting-edge techniques to solve real-world problems. My primary interests lie in data analysis, machine learning, and programming.

As a quick learner, I thrive on tackling new challenges in dynamic and creative environments. I am a collaborative team player, adaptable to new situations, and enjoy solving complex problems efficiently.

Currently, I am focused on expanding my expertise in data analysis, programming, machine learning, and deep learning. I actively explore new methodologies and work on projects to enhance my skills and practical knowledge.

Iâ€™m eager to contribute to meaningful projects and gain hands-on experience that pushes my boundaries while delivering value.
