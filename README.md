Hi, I am May !!

I’m a recent graduate in Digital Business and Data Science with hands-on experience in machine learning, NLP, and business analytics. I’ve built scalable ML pipelines, analyzed over 560K customer reviews for sentiment, and created real-time dashboards to visualize insights.

With a background in leadership as a former general manager, I bring strong teamwork, problem-solving, and cost optimization skills to technical projects. I’m passionate about combining data science and software engineering to develop impactful, efficient solutions.

I’m currently looking for opportunities as a Software Engineer, Data Scientist, or ML Engineer where I can grow my skills and contribute to meaningful projects.
